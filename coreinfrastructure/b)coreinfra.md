|Definations |Core infrastructure |Infrastructure is the foundation or framework that supports a system or organization. In computing, information technology infrastructure is composed of physical and virtual resources that support the flow, storage, processing and analysis of data. Infrastructure may be centralized within a data center, or it may be decentralized and spread across several data centers that are either controlled by the organization or by a third party, such as a colocation facility or cloud provider.|
|- |Physical Infrastructure |Physical infrastructure refers to the basic physical structures required for an economy to function and survive, such as transportation networks, a power grid and sewerage and waste disposal systems. Learn more in: Foreign Direct Investment Opportunities in Infrastructure Development|
|Types of physical infrastructure|Servers|The physical server vs virtual server comparison should start with the definition. A physical server, also known as a ‘bare-metal server,’ is a single-tenant computer server, meaning that a specific physical server is designated to a single user. The resources and components of a physical server are not shared between multiple users. Each physical server includes memory, processor, network connection, hard drive, and an operating system (OS) for running programs and applications. A bare-metal server is large in size due to the powerful processing components that it contains.|
|-|Routers|Switches and routers are the traffic coordinators of your network infrastructure – moving packets of binary data from one component to another on the same network (e.g., application to the database), or from one network to another (e.g., corporate network to the Internet). As the numbers of IT infrastructure devices, applications, and network connections grow and traffic volume increases, so, too, does the importance of switches and routers to your network performance and user productivity.Whether you are redesigning your network or building a new IT infrastructure.|
|-|Storage systems|The infrastructure of access to data storage devices is responsible for information availability for applications and final users that is why this component of data storage systems shows the most dynamic development. Instead of conventional direct connection of disc arrays to servers (DAS - Direct Attached Storage) technologies appeared and are now widely used based on use of network as infrastructure to access the data. SAN (Storage Area Network) technology uses dedicated network based on Fibre Channel protocol and exchanges data on the unit level. NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices are, in fact, the specialized file servers.|
|Components of Core infrastructure|Internet platforms|overlap with, and must relate to, the firm's general networking infrastructure and hardware and software platforms. Internet-related infrastructure includes the hardware, software and services to maintain corporate Web sites, intranets, and extranets, including Web hosting services and Web software application development tools. A Web hosting service maintains a large Web server, or series of servers, and provides fee-paying subscribers with space to maintain their Web sites.|
|-|Computer hardware|This component includes client machines (desktop PCs, mobile computing devices such as PDAs and laptops) and server machines. The client machines use primarily Intel or AMD microprocessors.   The marketplace for computer hardware has increasingly become concentrated in top firms such as IBM, HP, Dell, and Sun Microsystems, which produce 90 percent of the machines, and three chip producers, Intel, AMD, and IBM, which account for over 90 percent of the processors sold in 2004|
|-|Operating systems|include platforms for client computers, dominated by Windows operating systems, and servers, dominated by the various forms of the UNIX operating system or Linux. Operating systems are software that manage the resources and activities of the computer and act as an interface for the user.|
|-|Enterprise systems|include SAP, Oracle, and PeopleSoft, and middleware software that are used to link a firm's existing application systems.|
|-|Network and Telecommunications|include Windows server operating systems, Novell, Linux, and UNIX. Nearly all LAN and many wide area networks (WANs) use the TCP/IP standards for networking.|
|-|Consulting and Integrators|are relied on for integrating a firm's legacy systems with new technology and infrastructure and providing expertise in implementing new infrastructure along with relevant changes in business processes, training, and software integration. Legacy systems are generally older transaction processing systems created for mainframe computers that continue to be used to avoid the high cost of replacing or redesigning them.|
|-|Data management and Storage|is handled by database management software and storage devices include traditional storage methods, such as disk arrays and tape libraries, and newer network-based storage technologies such as storage area networks (SANs). SANs connect multiple storage devices on dedicated high-speed networks.
|operating system|windows 7|User-friendly, best for laptop and desktop user.Robust and reliable performance        Uses basic internet explorer for browsing. Windows 7 also shipped with updated versions of several stock applications, including Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player, and Windows Media Center.|
|-|linux|linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel.Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture.Linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e. devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, televisions, digital video recorders, video game consoles, and smartwatches.Many smartphones and tablet computers run Android and other Linux derivatives.[30] Because of the dominance of Android on smartphones, Linux has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.|
|-|Ubuntu|Ubuntu is a free operating system that uses the Linux kernel. Ubuntu is a popular operating system for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack.Ubuntu is developed by Canonical.Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release, starting from the release date and until the release reaches its designated end-of-life (EOL) date.|
|-|Fedora|Fedora is a popular open source Linux-based operating system.Fedora is designed as a secure, general purpose operating system.Fedora has a reputation for focusing on innovation, integrating new technologies early on and working closely with upstream Linux communitiesThe default desktop environment in Fedora is GNOME and the default user interface is the GNOME Shell. Fedora uses Security-Enhanced Linux by default, which implements a variety of security policies, including mandatory access controls.|
|-|Linux Mint|Linux Mint is a community-driven Linux distribution based on Ubuntu or Debian that strives to be a 'modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use.Linux Mint provides full out-of-the-box multimedia support by including some proprietary software, such as multimedia codecs, and comes bundled with a variety of free and open-source applications.Linux Mint primarily uses free and open-source software such as plug-ins and codecs that provide Adobe Flash, MP3, and DVD playback.Linux Mint actively develops software for its operating system. Most of the development is done in Python and the source code is available on GitHub|
|-|Debian|Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel. Linux is a piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. FreeBSD is an operating system including a kernel and other software.|
