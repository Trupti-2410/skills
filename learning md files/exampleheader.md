| name       | description         | type of database  |    
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| 
|mysql |MySQL is the most popular Open Source Relational SQL Database Management System. MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small and big businesses( Relational DataBase Management System)|SQL|
|oracle|An Oracle database is a collection of data treated as a unit. The purpose of a database is to store and retrieve related information.The database has logical structures and physical structures|SQL|
|mongo db|MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.The data model available within MongoDB allows you to represent hierarchical relationships, to store arrays, and other more complex structures more easily.MongoDB is one of the most popular non-relational databases|NoSQL|
|MariaDB|MariaDB is a “fork” (a project based on the source code) of MySQL.Because it is a fork, MariaDB is quite similar to MySQL|SQL|
|Redis|The name REdis means “REmote Dictionary Server”. It is an open-source, non-relational database.|NoSQL|
|PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL is an object-relational DBMS, with an emphasis on standards of compliance and extensibility.PostgresSQL fits for a single-machine application, a large internet-facing.PostgresSQL is coded in C language.|NoSQL|
|microsoft access database|Access is a relational database.Microsoft Access, a database management software designed to store, organize, modify, and even convert all the information in a more presentable form for easier interpretation.|SQL|
|amazon dynamoDB|Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation.|NoSQL|
|ibm db2|However, in the 1990s IBM changed track and produced a Db2 common product, designed with a mostly common code base for L-U-W (Linux-Unix-Windows).|SQL|
|big query|BigQuery is a fully-managed data warehouse on RESTful web service that enables scalable, cost-effective and fast analysis of big data working in conjunction with Google Cloud Storage.|-|
|Wide-Column Store|wide-column stores use columns to store data. You can group related columns into column families. Individual rows then constitute a column family.A typical column family contains a row key as the first column, which uniquely identifies that row within the column family. The following columns then contain a column key, which uniquely identifies that column within the row, so that you can query their corresponding column values.|NoSql |
|Document Store|Document store databases use JSON, XML, or BSON documents to store data. You can pretty much fill in a document with whatever data you want. Documents can have different structures, but you can index common fields for faster performance.|NoSql|
|Key-Value Data Store|Key-value databases store data in unique key-value pairs, meaning each key is associated only with one value in a collection, like in a dictionary. This makes querying a key-value data store fast because of its simple model. There’s no query language needed. Data retrieval is a simple matter of using get, put, and delete commands.|NoSQL|
|Graph db|Graph databases use nodes that contain lists of relationship records. These records represent relationships with other nodes, which eliminates the (time-consuming) search-match operation found in relational databases.Nodes and relationships are the bases of graph databases.|NoSQL|
